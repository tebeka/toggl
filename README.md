# toggle - Simple toggl command line

This is a simple command line to start/stop timers on [toggl](https://toggl.com/). I scratched an itch, hope you'll find it useful.

## Usage

    toggl -h
    usage: toggl start <project>|stop|status|projects
      -version
            show version and exit

You'll need a `~/.togglrc` with your API key and project id. See an example
[here](togglrc-example).

## Installing

If you have the Go SDK then

    go get github.com/tebeka/toggl

Or you can download the binary from the [release section](https://github.com/tebeka/toggl/releases).
